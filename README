# Eikon backend takehome assignment

I'm John Walthour, and this is my submission for the backend developer position.  Please don't hesitate to reach out with any questions at john.walthour at gmail.com.

## Building
To build:
* Clone on a machine with Docker
* Run `./build.sh`

## Running
To start the service, run `./run_etl_service.sh` on a machine with Docker.  This will start both the ETL service, and a postgreSQL database to support it.

If you wish to run just the ETL service, and connect it to your own postgres instance, please either edit `compose.yaml` or consult `./run_etl_service.sh` for an example command that
configures the ETL service appropriately.

## Using
To start an ETL job, either run `./start_etl_process.sh`.  This file is just one `curl` command, so you can also run it in another client if you prefer.

To see the results of theh ETL job, run `./query_db_for_results.sh`.  Alternatively, connect to the postgreSQL instance and run `select * from user_experiment_stats;`.
